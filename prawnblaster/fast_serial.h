/*
  Faster serial functions

  fast_serial_read/fast_serial_read_until are blocking functions
  designed to receive data over a USB serial connection as fast as possible
  (hopefully at the limit of the drivers).
  fast_serial_read is generally much faster (~4x) than fast_serial_read_until,
  as it can read larger blocks of data without having to scan for the terminating character.
  Therefore, it is recommended to use fixed size blocks for large transmissions.

  fast_serial_write is a blocking function
  designed to send data over a USB serial connection as fast as possible
  (again hopefully at the limit of the drivers).

  The remaining functions are thin wrappers around TinyUSB functions;
  they are provided to simplify the API.

  Basic usage:
  Call fast_serial_init()
  In the main processing loop, call fast_serial_task.
  Place calls to fast_serial_read/fast_serial_read_until and fast_serial_write where appropriate.
